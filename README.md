# Coursera-Shiny-Project

This Shiny App is a simple  interactive map interface to findout the ethinic-wise county-wise popultion density.

The data for this project is counties.rds, a dataset of demographic data for each county in the United States, 
collected with the UScensus2010 data R package.

This project is just a learning process and I tried to include images and other stuffs to the application.

I have published the application on ShinyApp cloud and can be viewed by clicking the following link.

The required data and ui.R server.R are residing in this Repository.

How to Use this.

At right side Input Panel is located.

Please select the Ethinic Group from the dropdown Text Box for which you want to get the Heat map of the Population Density in USA.

Also select the range of density using the slider widget.

The main panel will disply your selected values and  a Heat map as per your selection will be displyed below.
