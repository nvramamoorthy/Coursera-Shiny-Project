# Coursera-Shiny-Project

This Shiny App is a simple  interactive map interface to findout the ethinic-wise county-wise popultion density.

The data for this project is counties.rds, a dataset of demographic data for each county in the United States, 
collected with the UScensus2010 data R package.

This project is just a learning process and I tried to include images and other stuffs to the application.

I have published the application on ShinyApp cloud and can be viewd clicking the following link.
